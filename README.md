**What Makes a Good Journaling App**

`
A paper notebook and pen are fine for journaling, but apps offer more. They give you more context on what you've accomplished and where you might want to go, and let you include photos from your phone or posts from your social media feeds to make the journaling experience more rewarding. Add in reminders and the ability to search your journal entries, and digital journaling is almost a no-brainer.
`

**The best apps to keep a journal have a few things in common:**

- **Easy entry:** If it takes more than a couple of clicks or taps to add a journal entry, chances are you're not going to do it.
- **Pleasant interface:** A minimalist, uncluttered interface helps you focus on your thoughts and make journaling a pleasant experience.
- **Reminders:** Perhaps the biggest challenge to journaling is remembering to do it. Automatic reminders help you keep up the habit.
- **Exporting:** Just in case the app stops being developed or you want to move to a different journaling platform, you'll want to be able to export your entries in a format other programs can read, such as PDF or RTF.
- **Syncing:** Syncing will make sure your journal's up to date no matter what device you're using.

`Other features that might be important to you include password protection, Markdown support, ability to add more than one photo, automatically adding location and weather, and journaling prompts.
